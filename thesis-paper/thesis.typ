= Introduction

== Background and Objectives
A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of the Reinforcement Learning domain which focuses on the interaction between multiple agents in a shared environment. Through the recent years, an increasly amount of research has been conducted in this field to resolve issue that has arisen in the reel world. However, most of the research are done through simulations on environments which does not involve incremental changes. This thesis aims to evaluate the learning performance of MARL algorithms from a know environment to an slightly modified one by adding an unknown element. Under the suppervision of Prof. Tom Lenaerts, and advisor Yannick Molinghen, from the Machine Learning Group (MLG) of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB).
