= Introduction

== Background and Objectives
A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of the Reinforcement Learning domain which focuses on the interaction between multiple agents in a shared environment. Through the recent years, an increasly amount of research has been conducted in this field to resolve issue that has arisen in the reel world. However, most of the research are done through simulations on environments which does not involve incremental changes. This thesis aims to evaluate the learning performance of MARL algorithms from a know environment to an slightly modified one by adding an unknown element. Under the suppervision of Prof. Tom Lenaerts, and advisor Yannick Molinghen, from the Machine Learning Group (MLG) of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB).

Currently, the research is focused on the the environment of LLE (Laser Learning Reinforcement) which is a environment created by Yannick Molinghen. The environment is a grid world where a single or multiple agents are placed in a grid world. The goal of the agent is to reach a target while avoiding obstacles.

The objective of the Master thesis is to develop a new feature in the LLE environment that was also includes in the original Game morever this feature has also a other objective which is to add a new element in the environment which are not included in the agents learning process.

= State of the Art
== Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
// use article that explain different MAS article to explain what is MARL
// new why MARL is intresting
// get the mollinghen article to explain the LLE environment
// explain why adding a new element in the environment is intresting
// explain LLE agent standard
